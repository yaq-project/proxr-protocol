A sans I/O Python implementation of the [Highway Adressable Remote Transducer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_Addressable_Remote_Transducer_Protocol).

## Introduction

This Python package contains tooling for encoding and decoding bytestrings for communication with ProXR peripherals.
HART has been implemented using a variety of transport layers---XBee, RS485, Ethernet, etc.
In persuit of simplicity and reusability, this package does not contain any interface capabilities.
Use something like [pySerial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io) for transport.
Read the [sans I/O manifesto](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) for more motivation regarding this design pattern.
